# Developer test
## Description
This is a test for developer recruitment candidates. The purpose of this test is to provide a fair point of comparison between candidates and help the recruiter assess the candidate's skills based on an assignment that the interviewer is familiar with. The technologies are chosen to be similar to what are used at Komu and the task is something that we had to solve earlier while developing our product.

## Criteria
Please put attention to the following criteria when completing the assignment:
* Correctness: Your solution should do exactly what is specified.
* Quality: Your code should follow good practices and demonstrate your craftsmanship.
* Relevance: Your solution should be relevant to the task and not over-engineered.

## Repository
The repository has been prepared to give you a starting point. Just run `npm install` and `npm test` to run the tests. `src` directory is all yours! Implement your solution and relevant tests there. Split your code to several files if that feels appropriate. If you need to add any dependencies or tweak TypeScript configuration, feel free to do so.

However, provide a single endpoint to your solution, as the default export from `src/generateSlots.ts`

## Documentation
You don't have to document your solution, but please document your process. We want to know where you spent your time and how much time you spent.

### ChatGPT
We tried to come up with a task that is not trivial to implement with the help of an AI agent. We won't prevent you from using such assistance, but please document how and to what extent you used it. We however encourage you to demonstrate your own skills rather than rely on ChatGPT even though that's available in day-to-day work.

## Task
// TODO: Add the task description here.
// TODO: Add a tsconfig that defines the build folder. Set that directory up as the main endpoint in package.json.
